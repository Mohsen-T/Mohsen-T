### 👋 About Me

I’m **Mohsen**, a senior software engineer with **8+ years of professional experience** building production-grade systems across **full-stack web development, blockchain, and cloud infrastructure**.

While I’m well known for my work in **DeFi, smart contracts, and Web3**, my core strength is **end-to-end system design** — from backend APIs and databases to modern frontends and cloud deployments.

I’ve helped startups grow from early MVPs to high-traffic platforms by writing clean, secure, and maintainable code, leading engineering teams, and translating business ideas into reliable technical solutions.

I thrive in **remote-first, fast-moving teams**, and I enjoy working on products that combine **data, automation, AI-assisted workflows, and scalable architecture**.
